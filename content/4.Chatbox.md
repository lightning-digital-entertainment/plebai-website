## Getting Started

Integrating the chatbox in your website is really easy. Simply add the lines below into the `<head>` section of any page that you want the chatbox to show up on.

```html
<script>
  var plebAiConf = {
    agentKey: "<agent key in hex>",
    chatTitle: "<your title>",
    primaryColor: "<colorcode in hex>",
    secondaryColor: "<colorcode in hex>",
    buttonColor: "<colorcode in hex>"
  };
</script>
<script src="https://i.current.fyi/static/plebai.js"></script>
<link
  rel="stylesheet"
  href="https://i.current.fyi/static/styles.css"
/>
```

### Adjusting the config object

The first `<script>` tag in the snippet above is used to pass a configuration object to chatbox. It holds the following four properties:

1. agentKey: The public key of the agent that chatbox will connect to (go to https://chat.plebai.com and click on agent to copy the ID).
2. chatTitle: The title that will be displayed at the top of chatbox.
3. primaryColor: The primary color of the chatbox component (topbar and submit button background).
4. secondaryColor: The secondary color of the chatbox component (response background)
5. buttonColor: ButtonColor to match the home page. optional. defaults to white
